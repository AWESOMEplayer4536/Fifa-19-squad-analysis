Summary
With the data of 18,207 players, the objective was to identify the top players in their respective positions so as to build a good squad especially for online gamers and even new players so as to have a tight edge over their opponents in terms of their squad. Also, the best free kick and penalty takers were also identified.
The data used here has over 18,000 players and gamers would definitely go for top players with very good ratings. However, selecting players looking at their overall is not a good idea because there are several other attributes such as sprint speed, interception etc., that are important. And players with uniform distribution of all these skills are in fact the ones to watch out for.
For example, Sergio Busquets and Cesc Fabregas are of course great players in real life as well as in FIFA 19 with an overall rating of 89 and 84 respectively. However, professional gamers would rather not pick them even after having a good overall rating. The reason for that would firstly be their very low sprint speeds and secondly these players are more expensive to purchase. Moreover, these are players with very high IQ, but unfortunately here it’s the individual gamer’s IQ that matters the most.
Therefore, it's imperative for gamers to pick the right set of players so as to build a good quality team.
Design
Page 1: E-sports was one of the buzz words in the year 2018 and we saw or are seeing an unprecedented and a phenomenal rise of this industry. Fifa e-sports tournaments have begun from a little over time, but they have managed to build a huge industry within themselves with past two years especially with several football leagues such as the English Premier League have come up with a league specially dedicated for e-sports named ‘E-Premier League’.
Coming onto the game, the game was released worldwide on September 28, 2018 with Cristiano Ronaldo being the front cover for the second successive year alongside Neymar Jr. The game was released with huge expectations from both the EA Sports as well as the fans all over the world.
So, my objective using this data was to analyze the best set of players from their respective positions so as to build a good squad. Simply picking players based on their overall attribute would always be inappropriate because there are also several other attributes such as sprint speed, interceptions, dribbling, strength, tackling etc., which have huge impact within players. Moreover, it is always not possible to pick the best player from each position categories as they will be priced very high and would stay within the allocated budget, if the budget is low.
Page 2: The brief statistics were to be looked upon so as create any new ideas for new findings. Therefore, the players preferred foot, the average weight and height were plotted and analyzed.
Since the data consists of details of over 18,000 players from various leagues set in different parts of the world, it is important to have an insight of the overall average of the player’s weight, height and their preferred foot.
So, for visualization I have created a pie chart to find the percentage of left footed and right footed players and analyzed the average weight and height using histogram.
Pie charts are used for better visualization so as to differentiate between left footed and right footed players. For finding the average weight and height from a huge data, histogram was plotted and then their averages were obtained and is also easier for visualization.
Page 3: The top 20 players were analyzed using a bar graph by just using their overall attribute.
Bar graphs can easily differentiate players based on their ratings and visually it's much easier to identify the player with highest rating using bar graph
Out of the 20 top players, 5 of them were goalkeepers and the rest belonging to their respective positions. Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus F.C. and Lionel Messi are the two players with the highest rating of 94 respectively.
Page 4: So, when it comes to defense, the positions normally consist of two Centre backs (CB) or are considered as Left Centre Back (LCB) or right Centre Back (RCB). The other two defenders are commonly known as wing backs and position wise known as Left Back (LB) and Right Back (RB).
Therefore, for the above-mentioned positions top 10 players were analyzed based on their overall, Sprint speed, Standing tackle, Interception and Positioning attributes. The best defenders were analyzed using bar graph which can be used for better visualization and the best players can easily picked based on the bar chart.
Page 5: Again, when it comes to the position of midfield, it consists of 3 sub-position namely Central Defensive Midfielder (CDM) who plays closer to the defense. The other being Central Midfielder (CM), from whom both the offense and defense look upon to create and develop plays. Then there is Attacking Midfielders namely Central Attacking Midfielders (CAM), who are also expected to make plays and at the same time to create attacking threat in front of the goal.
Therefore, attributes such as Sprint speed, Interceptions and Dribbling etc., were considered. And I have created a bar chart with key attributes such as Sprint speed, Interception, Dribbling, Vision and Overall for easy visualization, picking as well as comparison with player is easier.
Page 6: Strikers and Wingers are the common goal scoring threat to any team.
Therefore, it was analyzed using bar chart with Sprint speed, Skill moves, Dribbling and Composure as the key attributes so as to provide easier visualization. Bar chart was used here so that each top player capability can be differentiated with ease.
Page 7: Having a good goal keeper is critically important because most of the goal keeping movements are controlled by the artificial intelligence.
And the best set of shot stoppers were analyzed using bar chart with attributes such as reflexes, handling, diving and Positioning. I have used bar chart here so that every considered attribute can be closely visualized and easy to differentiate.
Page 8: It is important to have set piece specialists in the team because these are crucial goal scoring opportunities especially in situations when build-up plays do not work in favor. Therefore, the best free kick and penalty scorers were also analyzed using bar chart.
Also, after receiving feedback, I have also created another visualization using pie chart for analyzing the accuracy of freekicks and penalties based on the preferred foot of all players. Pie charts provide better visualization for differentiating the free kick and penalty accuracy by left and right footed players.
Feedback
• The one feedback I received from my friend was to how to identify a good player for low budget? For example, if I wanted a good CDM with good sprint speed and interception attributes, how can one be able to interpret from this analysis?
• And I was also asked to create a graphical interpretation of best free kick and penalty taker.
• Since there was no price tag attribute column for players, I did not bring that thought into this but there is another attribute named ‘value’, which depicts the player value in the current transfer market. So, its common in football as well as in other sports as well, the most experienced and excelled players would be highly valued when compared to the newly recruited ones. Therefore, by looking at the player values, the price or futcoins (the term used in fifa games for money) required to buy the players can be assumed low or high easily.
• Also, I have added the best penalty and free kick takers using bar chart. And the overall accuracy of their respective foot was also visualized using pie chart.
